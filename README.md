# Customer-Segmentation-in-Retail-market
The project aimed to create a customer segmentation system tailored for online retailers by blending the strengths of hybrid k-means and hierarchical clustering methods. This system would enable the retailers to devise targeted promotions effectively.

The decision to adopt this approach was based on several factors. K-means exhibited superior performance and speed, particularly for expansive datasets, making it a popular choice for segmentation tasks. On the other hand, hierarchical clustering demonstrated better outcomes when dealing with higher values of 'k' and offered results that were easier to interpret. It was recognized that alongside the selection of the algorithm, the methods of data pre-processing and cluster determination were crucial in achieving optimal results. Consequently, a synergistic approach combining both hierarchical and k-means techniques was deemed optimal for achieving the most favorable outcomes.

The results of this endeavor were notable. The model achieved an accuracy rate of 86.8% in effectively predicting customer segments. Hierarchical clustering showcased its proficiency in managing smaller datasets, although computation time was observed to be lengthier than with k-means for larger datasets. The adjusted random score, which gauges similarity, indicated a significant degree of agreement between K hierarchical clustering, measuring around 96%.
